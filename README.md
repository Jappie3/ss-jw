This repo contains the JW Route which is used for the Silksong 100% category.
The 'official' document can be found on
[google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bKXTu8ZtDbsMReaRgIrm2zAMZHon7sl8yN3AkbycfJM/edit).

The document in this repository is written in markdown and contains HTML
comments to indicate [live split](https://livesplit.org/) splits. A github
actions script parses the markdown file & automatically generates a `splits.lss`
file (see `Actions` > most recent run > `Artifacts`)

(note: not the entire document has been annotated with split markers yet)
